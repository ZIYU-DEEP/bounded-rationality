On the other hand, the best case scenario when I choose A is 0 reward (if Player_2 chooses B), but the best case scenario for choosing B is only -1 reward (if Player_2 also chooses B). Therefore, choosing A provides a better worst case outcome and also a better best case outcome. \n",

      "In terms of probability, given no information on the likelihood of either condition_1 or condition_2, I will have to assume that they are both equally likely. This assumption is based purely on lack of information and therefore, it's the most reasonable assumption I can make. Considering this, my safest option that could potentially result in a reward without incurring any loss is to choose action D. If the condition_1, I would have a neutral outcome (0 reward), and if condition_2, I could still achieve the same neutral outcome (0 reward). That makes action D the most rational choice given this assumption.\n"
